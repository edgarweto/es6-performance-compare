1. Intro: why and how to measure es6 vs es5

- def: C(x) := cost of x

2.1 - Let vs var vs const
 2.1.1 - Similar times
 2.1.2 - C('let') ~ C('var')
 2.1.3 - C('let inside for') ~ C('var/let outside for')
 2.1.4 - 'let inside for' => does not require new scope/closure, but 'let outside for' does!
 2.1.5 - C('const') ~ C('var')

2.2 Template Strings

* Enhanced object literals
* Desctructuring
* Iterators + for-of
* Arrow functions
* Default values
* classes
* Generators
* Mat | Set | WeakMap | WeakSet
* Symbols

2.3 TODO's

* Add service for popularity
* Sort by popuparity
* Add service for uploading tests results along with machine, browser and env data

* Improve performance measure: loop until percentual differences doesn't change from iteration to iteration
* UI: run on webworkers in order to leave UI responsive
* UI: progress bars
* UI: cancel running tests
